As follow up to our latest discussion, I looking to setup a project buy-out.
I acknowledge that the state of the current application needs improvement before we can take steps to close this engagement.
The action item(s) that I see:
- 1. Dallas county search   
  - 1.1 The time needed to retrieve records is unacceptable   
  - 1.2 Ensure completeness of record reading   
  - 1.3 Validate successful execution of court search   
    - 1.3.1 County court   
    - 1.3.2 District court   
    - 1.3.3 Justice court 
		
		
In order to address the above concerns:
1. Created new version of software 
2. Tested performance of application using 3/12/2025 as filing date.
	a. For County court, retrieved 17 records in [2] minutes
	b. For District court, retrieved 74 records in [3] minutes
	c. For Justice court, retrieved 211 records in [14] minutes
3. Tested performance of application using 3/12/2025 TO 3/14/2025 as filing dates.
	c. For Justice court, retrieved 704
