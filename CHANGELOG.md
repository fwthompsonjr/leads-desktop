# Release | 2.8.7.x Setup user friendly context menus

## Problem:
			
When performing search, 
expectation is that the search will echo status messages 
back to the caller and that messaging has value 
to represent progress of the search process.

## Search Process
- browser window should be hidden
- override should allow admin to toggle window visibility
- process should report percent completion during execution

### Testing

Execution of backwards compatibility tests, 
as well as api tests to validate remote access.
