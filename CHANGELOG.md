# Release | 2.8.5 Review execution for counties

## Problem:
			
When a user opens the application
I want the user to enter login credentials
so that all application functions are tied to an user account.

## Resolution:
- [x] Add a login process
- [x] Setup user account to read and authenicate to remote service
- [x] Update package to generate release

### Testing

When a user runs application against a specific county, 
I want the search to execute as expected
so that all application functions are working as designed.
